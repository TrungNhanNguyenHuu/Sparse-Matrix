# Sparse-Matrix
This is an assignment in Data Structure And Algorithm Subject

Use dynamic array to implement a sparse matrix data structure

Advantages of using Sparse Matrix instead of simple matrix: 

1/ Storage: There are lesser non-zero elements than zeros and thus lesser memory can be used to store only those elements.
  
2/ Computing time: Computing time can be saved by logically designing a data structure traversing only non-zero elements.
